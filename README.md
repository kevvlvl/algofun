# Algofun

This repository are examples of how to solve various leetcode problems.

Why? Because it's fun, but more so for two benefits:
1. Regularly practice Go
2. Practice algorithms that I don't have a chance to work with in my day to day as a DevOps / Platform Engineer which is less algorithm intensive than the reality of an SDE

Are these the most optimized solutions? They are not. Feel free to go through these for your personal benefits
